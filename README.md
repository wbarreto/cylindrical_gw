Initial date (of developing):      29.06.18
Final date (ready for production): 

CHANGELOG:

Evolving (compiling well and living) code:

- makefile
- control deck
- driver (cgw.f)
- grid, basis and frame as an unchanged strutcture (base.f)
- maximal dimensions and allocations (base.inc)
- Solver for a linear system of equations (gaussj.f) (from Numerical Recipes)

NOTES:

Check only one of these stages:

- still developing (check)
- still debugging
- still not used in production
- in production 

TO DO (next tasks):

- initial data (init.f)
- Pseudo code
- Algorithmic
- History, referential script and codes (pre-codes)
